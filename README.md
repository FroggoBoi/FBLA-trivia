# FBLA-trivia
HIIIIIII!!!!!


This is where all the source code for the FBLA trivia project will be stored.

All we need to do now is complete the following

- get trivia questions (excel file)
- get music for the game
- finish front-end code
- get back mechanics finished
- integrate the questions into the source files

POSSIBLE ISSUES:

- the excel file is corrupted
- using an SQL file will not work
- An array may be too much space
- It just might plain look bad
